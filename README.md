### Author: Jordan Frew (s8103955)

This repository contains a simple Password Manager application developed for the ICTPRG302 – Apply Introductory Programming Techniques assessment at Victoria University.

The purpose of the program is to allow DigiCore staff to store and retrieve login credentials securely, replacing insecure methods such as writing passwords on sticky notes. The program uses ROT3 encryption to encode stored credentials and saves all records to a text file.
